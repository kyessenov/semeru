Eran Yahav
==========

Predictive versus descriptive model. 
ROC curve, precision and recall.

Control and object tracelets abstractions.

Code fusion as a query.
* define context
* specify extension points

PFSA algorithm for clustering and similarity search.

LEIDOS
======

Java in corpus.

Sparql API 

11/14: basic
2/15: initial
4/15: baseline

benchmark problems
* submit one benchmark
* need Eclipse with version information

Graph mining
============

Matching, approximate query, similarity measure inference. gMatch??? algorithm. Index for big graphs.

Experiments
===========

* demo test runner (start/stop with storage)
* exercise more features from Eclipse
* similarity search for Swing tutorials
  * replicate Eran's results for binaries

* interaction with the environment to learn and build better system

make use of static analysis results in deducing better code

TODO
====
* send heap graph to LogicBloks 
* Swing example or two with seeded bug to SRI

reactive applications
  payment system, request/response type of applications
you're not that original

Muse meeting
============

May, 15. Hawaii.
Factorization machines.

Miryung
=======

Software reconnaisance.
Program comprehension, feature identification.
