## Input

* positive and negative demonstration traces
* full traces

## Concept analysis

* use comparative analysis from a single trace

## Algorithm

* calculate footprints for the demonstration
* project to invoked framework methods
* project to definitions of overridden methods
* restrict the compressed footprints to the two sets of methods

## Output
